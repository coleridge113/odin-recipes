        <p>Lasagna is an Italian dish made of alternating layers of pasta, meat or vegetables, and cheese, all baked
            together in a dish. The pasta is typically made of wheat flour and eggs and is cooked before being assembled
            with the other ingredients. The meat or vegetables used in lasagna can vary, but common options include
            ground beef, sausage, and tomato sauce for a classic meat lasagna, or eggplant, zucchini, and bell peppers
            for a vegetarian version. Cheese is often grated or sliced and placed between the layers of pasta and
            filling, and the lasagna is then baked until the cheese is melted and the dish is heated through. Lasagna is
            typically served hot and can be garnished with fresh herbs or additional grated cheese before serving.</p>
        <p>The origins of lasagna are somewhat unclear, but the dish has been a part of Italian cuisine for many
            centuries. The word "lasagna" likely derives from the Greek word "lasagnum," which referred to a cooking
            pot. The earliest known recipe for lasagna-like dish can be traced back to a cookbook from the 14th century
            called "The Forme of Cury," which contained a recipe for a dish called "loseyn." This dish consisted of
            layers of pasta and a filling made of ground meat and spices, similar to modern lasagna. However, it is
            likely that the dish has evolved and changed over time, with different regions and families putting their
            own unique twists on the recipe. Today, lasagna is enjoyed all over the world and can be made with a variety
            of different fillings and ingredients.</p>

        <h2>Steps to make a lasagna:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the desired temperature (usually 350-375°F).
            </li>
            <li>Cook the pasta according to the package instructions. It is important not to overcook the pasta, as it
                will continue to cook in the oven and can become mushy if it is already overcooked.
            </li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, prepare the filling. If using ground meat, brown it in a pan over medium
                heat until it is fully cooked. If using vegetables, slice and dice them as desired and sauté them in a
                pan until they are tender.
            </li>
            <li>In a separate pan, prepare the tomato sauce by heating canned or homemade tomato sauce over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and set it aside.
            </li>
            <li>Assemble the lasagna by spooning a layer of tomato sauce into the bottom of a large, shallow baking
                dish. Top the sauce with a layer of pasta, followed by a layer of the filling, and a layer of cheese.
                Repeat these layers until all of the ingredients are used up, making sure to finish with a layer of
                cheese on top.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the oven. Bake the lasagna for 30-40 minutes,
                or until the cheese is melted and the dish is heated through.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish
                with additional cheese or fresh herbs if desired. Enjoy!
