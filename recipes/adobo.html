            <p>Adobo is a traditional Filipino dish that is made by marinating meat, poultry, or seafood in a mixture
                of vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and black peppercorns. The marinade is used to both flavor and preserve
                the protein, and the resulting dish is typically savory and slightly tangy.</p>
            <p>Adobo is a popular dish in the Philippines and is often considered the national dish. It is usually made
                with chicken or pork, but other proteins such as beef, lamb, and seafood can also be used. The meat is
                marinated in the adobo mixture and then simmered until tender in a pot or slow cooker. Adobo is often
                served with rice and can be garnished with additional vinegar or soy sauce to taste. It is a flavorful
                and hearty dish that is enjoyed by many people in the Philippines and around the world.</p>

            <h2>Steps to make adobo:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose your protein: Adobo can be made with chicken, pork, beef, lamb, or seafood. Cut the protein
                    into desired portions.</li>
                <li>Make the marinade: In a large bowl or plastic bag, combine 1 cup vinegar, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1
                    tablespoon minced garlic, and 1 tablespoon black peppercorns. Add the protein to the marinade and
                    stir or toss to coat evenly. Marinate the protein in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 8
                    hours.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat a large pot or slow cooker on the stovetop over medium heat. Remove the protein from the
                    marinade and reserve the marinade.
                </li>
                <li>Cook the protein: Add the protein to the pot or slow cooker and sear it on all sides until it is
                    browned.
                </li>
                <li>Add the marinade: Pour the reserved marinade over the protein. Bring the mixture to a boil, then
                    reduce the heat to low and simmer the adobo until the protein is tender and fully cooked, about 1
                    hour for chicken or pork, or 2 hours for beef or lamb. If using a slow cooker, cook the adobo on low
                    heat for 6-8 hours.
                </li>
                <li>Serve the adobo: Remove the protein from the pot or slow cooker and slice or shred it as desired.
                    Serve the adobo with rice and garnish with additional soy sauce or vinegar to taste. Enjoy!
